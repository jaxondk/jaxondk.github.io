# About Me

### Yours Truly
I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science at Brigham Young University with a Business Minor. Most of my internships were all for software development positions, and then around my senior year I realized I was fascinated with machine learning and wanted to pivot into that field. I was fortunate enough to land a position as a Machine Learning Researcher at Stratesis Technologies, LLC - a technology-based hedge fund. While there I discovered the fastai library and have worked hard to transition the company to deep learning.

My dream is to solve real-world problems - especially in the lives of those who suffer disproportionately. I feel that I have  received so much but up to this point have given so little in comparison. I hope to acquire skillsets that will allow me to fulfill this dream, and believe I am making real progress to that end. If any of you are working on solving such problems as poverty, homelessness, recidivism, healthcare, etc. (especially by using data science), please feel free to contact me using the links in the footer.
