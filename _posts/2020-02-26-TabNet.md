# Exploring TabNet by Google

### Motivation for Post
At my company we're investigating deep learning as it applies to financial tabular data. This is a fairly under-researched area and so I've been conducting a lot of my own experiments. This has been great (I've learned a ton), but when you're at a start-up, "speedy results" is the name of the game. That's why I was thrilled to discover that Google recently published a paper called [TabNet: Attentive Interpretable Tabular Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf). This post will essentially be my notepad as I explore the ins and outs of this approach. As such, this post will be very disorganized; I hope to write up a post that is more suited for public consumption in the future.
