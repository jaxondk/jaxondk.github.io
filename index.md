### Fresh Data Science Discoveries, Best Served Warm
Welcome to the Best Served Warm blog! My name is Jaxon Keeler and I hope to share my data science journey as candidly as possible. This blog will be where I publish my most recent discoveries in the world of data science, as well as other thoughts on the process of developing a career in data science. While some posts will be polished and thorough, many will be works-in-progress that I will update in real-time as I work through a particular subject matter. I want all my readers to experience the journey with me and to see that it's OK to make mistakes along the way. I hope to encourage budding practitioners to keep going, and I hope that my own progress in this field serves as inspiration.
